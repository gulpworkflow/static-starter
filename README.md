# Ripe Static Starter
*More Documentation to be added*

## Installing a new project
##### Step 0—Navigate to where you would like your project to be located
Open the terminal(we prefer iTerm) and navigate to the correct location
	```
	cd you/can/go/anywhere
	```

##### Step 1— Run the install script
To install a new static site run the install script command followed by the name of your new project
*Note replace [project-name] with the name of your project*
	```
	bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ripestudios/src--static-site/master/install.bash) [project name]
	```

##### Step 2—Install Node Modules
The install script will prompt you if you would like to install the node modules for the new project
*Note these are close to 200mb*

##### Step 3—Enjoy
Carry forth and make something awesome!
